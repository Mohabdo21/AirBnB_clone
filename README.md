# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Overview
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This is the first step towards building our first full web application. The console created in this project will be used in all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.

This project is done by the team: Sara Khalid Mustafa and Mohannad Babeker.

## Features
![alt text](https://github.com/Mohabdo21/AirBnB_clone/blob/main/process.png?raw=true)

The project has the following features:

- A parent class (BaseModel) that takes care of the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.
- A simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
- Classes for all entities used in AirBnB (User, State, City, Place, etc.) that inherit from BaseModel.
- The first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- Unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.

## Learning Objectives
This project will help us to learn about:

- Creating a Python package.
- Creating a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module.
- Implementing Unit testing in a large project.
- Serializing and deserializing a Class.
- Writing and reading a JSON file.
- Managing datetime.
- Understanding and using UUID.
- Using *args and **kwargs in Python.
- Handling named arguments in a function.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Run the console file to start the command interpreter.
